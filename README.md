1. [Madhava's correction terms]([url](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava%27s_correction_term)) - Madhava, a 14th century Indian mathematician comes up with a series of approximation terms to calculate the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter (Leibniz came up with this series independently later in the 17th century). He also comes up with a few correction terms according to when we terminate computing the sequence, that improves the level of approximation to a great extent.
