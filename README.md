1. [Madhava's correction terms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madhava%27s_correction_term) - Madhava, a 14th century Indian mathematician came up with a series of approximation terms to calculate the ratio of the circumference of a circle to its diameter (which is equal to pi). Leibniz also came up with this series independently later in the 17th century. Madhava also came up with a few correction terms that greatly improve the degree of approximation when we terminate the sequence.
