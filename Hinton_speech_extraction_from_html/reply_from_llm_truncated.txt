Based on the HTML you've provided, I can extract and combine the text segments from the transcript into a single, continuous piece of text. Here's the extracted and concatenated transcript:

"and then I'm going to talk about the difference between digital and analogue neural networks and why that difference is, I think is so scary. So since the 1950s, there have been two paradigms for intelligence. The logic inspired approach thinks the essence of intelligence is reasoning,"

If there are more segments you need to include or if there's anything else you need, feel free to let me know!

Prompt:

I'm watching a lecture on youtube and I want the transcript of its audio. But the transcript is timestamped and segmented. I got the HTML code of the transcript box, can you extract the contents for me and present it in a single piece of text?

Here's the html:
